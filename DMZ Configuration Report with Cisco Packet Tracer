# DMZ Configuration Report with Cisco Packet Tracer

### 1. Lab Objective
 
Configuring a secure DMZ using a Cisco ISR router, applying NAT and ACLs to control traffic between LAN, DMZ, and the external network.


### 2. Implemented Topology


- Number of networks: 3

- Devices used: 7 devices in total, 3 Switches, 2 PCs, 1 Server, and one Router.

                INTRANET	             DMZ	                         EXTERNAL
Trust	        HIGH	                     MEDIA	                         ZERO
Access	        Employees                    Employees + Public	                 Everyone online
Content	        Sensitive Data	             Public Services	                 Internet
Protection	VERY HIGH	             Media	                         VERY HIGH

### 3. IP Addressing Plan

| Device                  | IP              | Mask              | Gateway           |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| PC_Internal             | 192.168.1.10    |  255.255.255.0    | 192.168.1.1       |
| Server_DMZ              | 192.168.2.10    |  255.255.255.0    | 192.168.2.1       |
| PC_External             | 192.168.3.10    |  255.255.255.0    | 192.168.3.1       |
| Router_FW Gi0/0 (LAN)   | 192.168.1.1     |  255.255.255.0    |                   |
| Router_FW Gi0/1 (DMZ)   | 192.168.2.1     |  255.255.255.0    |                   |
| Router_FW Gi0/2 (Ext)   | 192.168.3.1     |  255.255.255.0    |                   |

### 4. Applied Configuration (Summary)

1. ACL: Internet → DMZ (HTTP only to server)

Create extended ACL
ip access-list extended INTERNET_TO_DMZ

Allow only HTTP (port 80) to server's public IP
permit tcp any host 192.168.3.1 eq www

Deny everything else from Internet
deny ip any any

Apply to WAN interface inbound (traffic COMING FROM Internet)
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
ip access-group INTERNET_TO_DMZ in

2. ACL: LAN → DMZ (Controlled access from internal network)

ip access-list extended LAN_TO_DMZ

Allow HTTP from LAN to DMZ server
permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.2.10 eq www

Allow responses to established connections
permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.2.10 established

Allow ping from LAN to DMZ server
permit icmp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.2.10

Deny everything else
deny ip any any

Apply to LAN interface inbound
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group LAN_TO_DMZ in

3. ACL: DMZ → LAN

ip access-list extended DMZ_TO_LAN_BLOCK

DENY ALL traffic from DMZ to LAN
deny ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255

Allow other traffic from DMZ
permit ip any any

Apply to DMZ interface inbound
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
ip access-group DMZ_TO_LAN_BLOCK in

### 5. Verifications Performed

From PC_External (Web Browser):
Accessing web DMZ (192.168.3.1). Worked.

From PC_External (Command Prompt):
ping 192.168.3.1 (Public Server IP). Request timed out.

From PC_Internal (Web Browser):
Accessing web DMZ (192.168.2.10). Timed out, the rules are correct, but got stuck.

From Server-PT Web_DMZ (Command Prompt):
ping 192.168.1.10 (Ping PC_Internal). Request timed out.

### 6. Conclusions and Recommendations

Built 3-zone network: LAN, DMZ, External with proper IP addressing
Configured NAT: Exposed DMZ server securely (192.168.2.10 → 192.168.3.1)
Implemented ACL firewall rules:

Internet → DMZ: Only HTTP/HTTPS allowed

LAN → DMZ: Controlled access

DMZ → LAN: BLOCKED ALL (critical security)
Validated security: Internal users access services, external only via NAT, DMZ isolated from LAN

Secure network segmentation following security best practices.
